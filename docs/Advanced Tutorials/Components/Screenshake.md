* Amount - The intensity of the 'Screenshake'.

> [!TIP]
>1-small, 2-normal, 3-big.

* One Time - Activates the screenshake only one time.

* Continuous - Makes the 'Screenshake' work continuously. That means the component will always work when activated. In order to stop the 'Screenshake' simply deactivate the gameobject the component is located in. It is recommended to use this.

* Min/Max Distance - Designates a range where the 'Screenshake' will work (i.e. how close the player needs to be to the gameobject with the 'Screenshake' component in order to experience it.)

> [!NOTE]
>Screenshake' will work as long as the gameobject it's put into is enabled.
