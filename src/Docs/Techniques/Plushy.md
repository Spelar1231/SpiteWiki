# Making Plushies

# Beginning

Making plushies is straightfoward. All you have to do is search a already existing dev's plushy in your assets, select it and duplicate it by pressing `CTRL + D`. Then, press `open prefab`, swap the model to yours and set the tag to `Item`. If needed, you can change the pickup/throw audio.
